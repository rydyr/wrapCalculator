# Wrap Calculator
Calculates layout points for spiral wrap assemblies 


### INPUTS:  
**Shell Diameter** - outside diameter of the shell being spiral wrapped.  
**Number of Wraps** - equal to the number of layout paths around the circumfrence of shell.  
**Shell Length** - length of the shell being spiral wrapped.  
**Lead** - the distance between parallel points of the same path.  
**Pitch** - the distance between parallel points of a different path.  

### OUTPUTS:  
**Circumfrence Marks** (Circ) - *Requires [Shell Diameter & Number of Wraps]* This output represents the starting point for each path around the circumfrence of a shell.  
**Laterall Marks** (Lat) - *Requires [Shell Length & Lead & Pitch]* This output represents the points along a horizontal plane that each path intersects at a specified interval.  


*Outputs are presented as fractions 1/16th of an inch or greater.
